# Count Instances of a Character in a String

Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and returns the number of times the first string (the single character) is found in the second string.

## Examples
```
count_occurrences("a", "edabit") ➞ 1

count_occurrences("c", "Chamber of secrets") ➞ 1

count_occurrences("b", "big fat bubble") ➞ 4
```

## Notes

* Your output must be case-sensitive (see second example).
