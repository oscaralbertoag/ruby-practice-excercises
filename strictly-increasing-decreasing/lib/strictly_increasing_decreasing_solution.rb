# ***************** Main function *****************

def check(numbers)
  # Step 1 - Account for use cases with fewer than two elements and return the correct value

  # Step 2 - Compare the first element on the list with the last element on the list to see if it could be descending

  # Step 2.a - If it seems like it could be descending, use your check_descending() helper method to check all elements and figure out which value to return

  # Step 2.b - If it isn't descending, use your check_ascending() helper method to figure out which value to return
end

# ***************** Helper functions  *****************

def check_ascending(numbers)
  # Return true if all values are ascending, false otherwise
end

def check_descending(numbers)
  # Return true if all values are descending, false otherwise
end
