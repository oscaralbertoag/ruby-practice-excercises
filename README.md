# Ruby Practice Exercises
This repository contains problems and solutions to help my sister while she is learning to program in Ruby. I'm learning with her, so the solutions may not be production quality, but they work!

## Problem Structure
Each challenge or problem will contain two directories:
* `lib` - contains skeleton file(s) to be completed to solve the challenge.
* `spec` - contains all tests to be run _and pass_ to successfully solve the challenge.

The directory will also contain a `.md` file with the problem definition and other instructions.
Create a Pull Request with your solution to have your solution reviewed and merged.

_Note: The majority of problems were taken from different programming challenge websites. I **AM NOT** claiming these as my own. I will do my best to credit the source of a problem moving forward._
