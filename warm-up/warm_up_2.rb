# WARM UP EXERCISE WORKSHEET 2
# Solve all problems. Sometimes a particular problem may have more than 1 correct answer. 
# Problems can also build on previous problems.

# 1) Create a method that takes a list of integers as a parameter, and returns the average (Float)

# 2) Create an array and push 5 strings (any string will suffice) into it

# 3) Find the Ruby function that allows you to get a random number. Create a statement that prints any random number

# 4) Create an array and push 5 random numbers to it by using the method learned in 4

# 5) Using Ruby's Date class, create a variable that holds today's date (don't forget to use require 'date')

# 6) Using Ruby's Date class, write a statement that returns true if today is a Friday, false otherwise. Store the result in a variable called 'is_friday'

# 7) Using Ruby's Date class, write a statement that returns true if today's date (day) is an even number, false otherwise. Store the result in a variable called 'is_even'

# 8) Using the variables created in 6 & 7, write a statement that returns true if today's date (day) is an even number AND it today is also a Friday, false otherwise. This should NOT use if/else (Hint: try testing different variations of days, and even/odd numbers to test different expressions)

# 9) Using the variables created in 6 & 7, write a statement that returns true if today's date (day) is an even number OR today is a Friday; false if neither one is true. This should NOT use if/else (Hint: try testing different variations of days, and even/odd numbers to test different expressions)

# 10) Using the variables created in 6 & 7, write a statement that returns true only if today's date (day) is an even number AND if today is NOT a Friday. This should NOT use if/else

# 11) Write an expression to generate a random number between 0 and 10

# 12) Write an expression to generate a random number between 50 and 100

# 13) Create an array, add 5 integers, and select a random element from it

# 14) Generate an array from a range. The range should start at 1 and finish at 10.

# 15) Create two arrays of 5 strings each. Create a new array that contains all elements from both arrays. This can be done with 1 line of code.

# 16) Create an array that contains all the characters in the alphabet with one line of code (hint: use a range: a - z, A - Z). Name this array 'character_set' .This can also be done with 1 line of code.

# 17) Choose a random element from your `character_set` array

# 18) Print numbers from 5 to 15 by using a loop. Each number should be on a new line.

# 19) Create a method called 'price_after_discount(original_price, discount)' that takes 2 paramenters, the first one is 'original_price' and the second one is named 'discount'
# The method should calculate the final price of an item after the discount (e.g.20%) has been applied. For example, original_price = 100, discount = 20, the result should be 80.0

# 20) Create a class PiggyBank. 
# 20.1) It has 1 instance variable called 'savings'. Create an initializer that takes no parameters and initializes 'savings' to zero.
# 20.2) It has a method called 'deposit(amount)' that will add 'amount' to 'savings'
# 20.3) It has a method called 'show_savings()' that will print a message in the format "You have saved $50 so far! YAY!" where 50 would be the value of 'savings'

# 21) Use a loop to print the letters of the alphabet backwards (hint: use a range to generate an array with the alphabet characters)

# 25) A personal shopping assistant charges you $50 an hour. She will give you a discount of 20% off the total price if you purchase 40 hours or more of her services. Create the method shopping_assistant_cost(total_hours) to calculate how much you will pay based on how many hours the shopping assistant worked for you. The method should return a Float.
# For example, if the total hours were 39, the total cost will be $1950
# If the total hours were 40, the cost will be $1600

# 26) You're a smart person with an organized budget. You decide that you will only spend 2% of your monthly salary on Starbucks. Create calculate_total_coffees(monthly_salary, cost_of_coffee_cup) that will tell you how many cups of coffee you can purchase per month based on your monthly salary and the cost of a coffee cup. 
# For example, if cost is $5 for your usual Venti caramel macchiato and your monthly salary is $8000, you can buy 32 Venti caramel macchiatos that month.

# 27) Create fahrenheit_to_celsius(temperature_in_fahrenheit) that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius (Float)

# 28) Create celsius_to_fahrenheit(temperature_in_celsius) that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit (Float)
